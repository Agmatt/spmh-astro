            Understanding a Hernia
          </h2>
          <p class='text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed'>
            A **hernia** occurs when an organ, usually a part of the intestine
            or fatty tissue, pushes through a weak spot in the surrounding
            muscle or connective tissue. This often creates a visible bulge.
            While not always an emergency, hernias typically don't go away on
            their own and can become serious if the bulging tissue gets trapped
            (incarcerated) or loses blood flow (strangulated).
          </p>
          <p class='mt-4 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed'>
            Herniorrhaphy is the surgical procedure dedicated to correcting this
            issue, relieving discomfort and preventing severe complications.

            The Repair Process (Herniorrhaphy)
          </h2>
          <p class='text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6'>
            The goal of the surgery is straightforward: push the bulging tissue
            back into place and close or reinforce the weakened area. We use two
            primary approaches, determined by your surgeon based on the hernia's
            size and location:

                1. Open Repair (Traditional)
              </h3>
              <p class='text-gray-700'>
                This involves a single incision near the hernia site. The
                surgeon pushes the hernia sac back into the abdomen and then
                reinforces the muscle wall. In most cases, a piece of sterile
                **surgical mesh** is placed over the weakness, providing a
                permanent "patch" to prevent the hernia from returning. The use
                of mesh is often referred to as **Hernioplasty**.

                2. Laparoscopic or Robotic Repair
              </h3>
              <p class='text-gray-700'>
                This technique uses several tiny incisions (often less than a
                half-inch). A small camera (laparoscope) and specialized
                instruments are inserted. This allows the surgeon to repair the
                hernia from the *inside* of the abdominal wall. This approach
                typically results in less pain, shorter hospital stays, and a
                quicker return to normal activity.

              **Length of Stay:** Most Herniorrhaphy procedures are performed on
              an **outpatient basis**, meaning you go home the same day.
            </li>
            <li>
              **Pain Management:** You will experience some pain or discomfort,
              which is managed effectively with prescription and
              over-the-counter pain medication.
            </li>
            <li>
              **Restrictions:** You must avoid **heavy lifting and strenuous
              exercise** for several weeks (typically 4-6 weeks) to allow the
              surgical repair to fully integrate and strengthen.

            <li>
              **Return to Activity:** Most patients are able to return to light,
